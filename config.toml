We were on top of our descriptive analytics game and worked to apply a more systematic approach to analyses to extract deeper information from our data. I mined our hosted blog and ran sentiment analyses with R to shed light on open-eneded participant feedback. I also worked to utilize logistic regression to quantify the quality of referrals being made and provide groundwork for a hopeful future recommender system to offer the participant ways to improve the likelihood of their referral selling. And didsome cluster analyses on our program population to delve into promotion results and answer why some groups perform better than others. \n\nAlways explored other, external Developed models based on historical performance to predict incentive spend and facilitate fine tuning of sales incentive programs. Integrated R into some of our analyses for both internal & external stakeholders. Final reporting is rendered in HTML with the knitr & flexdashboard packages allowing for great deal of interactivity between the stakeholder and the data for those without Tableau licenses."""
