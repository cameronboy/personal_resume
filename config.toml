We were on top of our descriptive analytics game and worked to apply a more systematic approach to analyses to extract deeper information from our data. I mined our hosted blog and ran sentiment analyses with R to shed light on open-eneded participant feedback. I tried out logistic regression to determine the probability of referrals selling, and experimented with clustering on our program population to delve into promotion results and answer why some groups perform better than others. \n\nAlways explored other, external Developed models based on historical performance to predict incentive spend and facilitate fine tuning of sales incentive programs. Integrated R into some of our analyses for both internal and external stakeholders. Final reporting is rendered in HTML with the knitr and flexdashboard packages allowing for great deal of interactivity between the stakeholder and the data for those without Tableau licenses."""
